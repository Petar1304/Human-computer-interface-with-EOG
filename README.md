# EOG CALIBRATION

### steps:
    - calibrate
    - get data from arduino
    - connect eog eye position data with position on screen
    - try KNN for getting command

### TODO:
    - menu (calibrate, controlMouse, startAcquisition)
    - calibration => look up, look down, look left, look right => get values => save mean

### Improvement:
    - Neural Network for calibration
